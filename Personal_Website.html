    <h5><b>About</b></h5>
    <p id = "story"> <b>Story:</b> From a young age, I was always fascinated with
      creating things. I was an average child that did well in school and played
      sports. One of the most valuable experiences I had
      was attending a professional training camp for baseball. There, I learned
      the work ethic I must have to grow as a player. I used these
      concepts to push myself, leading me to become the valedictorian of my
      high school, and attending Cornell University as a first-generation
      college student. In college, I chose to major in computer science
      without knowing much code. Through hard work and persistance, I have
      done well in my courses thusfar and have become a much better computer
      scientist. Aside from my major, I have conitnued to be active by working
      out and playing sports. With a better idea of my interests, I hope to reach
      the next chapter in my life of working for companies and helping them
      create products while continuing to pursue my hobbies.</p>
