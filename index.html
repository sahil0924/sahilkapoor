      <p id="early-text">I was born and raised in Long Island, New York. The city in which I
        grew up in was Lindenhurst, NY. I attended Lindenhurst Senior
      High School. In high school, I had the opportunity to explore different
      types of courses. I naturally narrowed my interests towards math, science,
     and business. I ended up graduating valedictorian and wanted to continue
      my interests in these subjects at Cornell. During my high school years, I
      developed hobbies of exploring nature, exercising, learning tech, and
      learning about different businesses.</p>

      <p>In 2018, I entered Cornell as a Bioengineer. I knew I wanted to create
          impact through engineer and pursue my interest in business. After I
          took my first coding class, I fell in love with coding. I recognized
          the tremendous capabilities and impact you can have in CS.</p>
